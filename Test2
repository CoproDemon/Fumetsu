  "description": "Her memories of being a military geek in her previous life awaken and she remembers she’s in the world of an otome game she played in her previous life. And what’s more, she’s what people refer to as a ‘villainess’.\n\nIn the game, the villainess is destined to face a destruction ending, but this girl is different. If you don’t want to be destroyed yourself, you have to destroy them first! In this way, our protagonist who is obsessed with recreating the power of modern weaponry using magical techniques by taking advantage of the magical talent bestowed upon the villainess, realizes it at last.\n\nThe heroine? The prince? Shaming her family? Being exiled from the country? If only a bad end is destined for her, then she has to crush it through sheer firepower!",
